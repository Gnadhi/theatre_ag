A Python framework for multi-agent oriented simulations, with a particular focus on modelling socio-technical systems.

Agent behaviours are defined with modular, hierarchically composable *workflows* defined as PO Python
classes.

The timing model in the SA Theatre is turn based, with each agent able to execute asynchronously within a turn.
Workflow tasks can be annotated with execution times, allowing the performance of tasks of different
complexity in a problem domain to be modelled.
